## Common Learning Challenges by Domain

### Domain: RBAC & Authorization (Exercise 04)

**Learning Challenge:**
Role-based access control has many nuances that aren't immediately apparent.

**Common Issues:**
- Role vs ClusterRole scope confusion
- Verb/resource combinations (what operations grant what access)
- Aggregated roles and role composition
- Subresource permissions not automatically granted

**Improvement in This Repo:** 
- Exercise 04 includes detailed subresources gotcha
- Documents that `*/scale` requires explicit entry
- Includes testing methodology: `kubectl auth can-i`
**Improvement Target:**

### Domain: NetworkPolicy (Exercise 05, 28)

**Learning Challenge:**
NetworkPolicy can be difficult to debug because enforcement depends on CNI implementation. 
**Improvement in This Repo:**
- Exercise 28 includes CNI awareness section
- Documents which CNIs enforce (Calico, Cilium, Weave) vs pass-through (flannel)
- Bidirectional rules pattern explained in gotchas

---

### Domain: Storage & PV/PVC (Exercise 12)

**Learning Challenge:**
PVC Pending state has multiple possible causes that require systematic diagnosis.
- PVC Pending state investigation (access modes, storage class, node affinity)
- Storage class selectors not obvious
- ReclaimPolicy affects whether PV can be reused
- Multiple storage backends (local, nfs, ceph) confuse new users

**Improvement Target:**
- Add section: "Why is my PVC Pending?" troubleshooting flowchart
- Document ReclaimPolicy behavior clearly
- Add exercise: Create PVC, fail, fix by adding storage class
- Real exam pattern: "Scale app from 1 to 3 replicas, PVCs fail because access mode is RWO not RWX"
**Improvement in This Repo:**
- Exercise 12 includes diagnostic flowchart (5-step decision tree)
- DIAGNOSTICS.md covers PVC Pending as major section
- ReclaimPolicy behavior clearly documented

---

### Domain: HPA & Scaling (Exercise 16)

**Learning Challenge:**
HPA requires proper metrics infrastructure setup which isn't always obvious.tern: "HPA created but not scaling — metrics are the culprit"

**Status:** ⏳ Ready to enhance `exercises/16-hpa/README.md`

## ⚠️ Time Management Feedback

### Most Time-Consuming Mistakes (From Community)
1. **Debugging RBAC** (avg 12 min lost) — should take 3-4 min
2. **NetworkPolicy testing** (avg 10 min lost) — unsure if policy is actually enforced
**Improvement in This Repo:**
- Exercise 16 includes pre-flight checklist (5-step verification)
- Exact commands for verifying metrics-server and pod requests
- DIAGNOSTICS.md includes metrics troubleshooting section

## Learning Feedback by Topic Area

### Tier 1: Well-Covered Topics
- ✅ Pod basics and multi-container patterns
- ✅ Deployment rollout strategies
- ✅ Static pod configuration and modification
- ✅ Jobs and CronJobs

### Tier 2: Needs Additional Content
- ⚠️ RBAC edge cases and subresources
- ⚠️ NetworkPolicy CNI compatibility
- ⚠️ Storage access modes selection
- ⚠️ HPA metrics prerequisites
- ⚠️ Kubeadm cluster upgrade procedure

### Tier 3: Advanced Topics
- 📚 LocalStorage and block device provisioning
- 📚 Custom scheduler configuration
- 📚 Advanced networking (CNI internals)
- 📚 Operator patterns

---

## Study Experience Insights

- Debugging RBAC issues commonly takes 10-15 minutes unnecessarily
- NetworkPolicy testing adds significant time without clear diagnosis methodology
- Storage troubleshooting is complex (multiple potential root causes)
- Having quick reference guides saves 5-10 minutes per complex topic

### Effective Study Methods (Validated by Community)
- ✅ Hands-on practice with clear success criteria
- ✅ Debugging using systematic checklists
- ✅ Timed practice to build time awareness
- ✅ Review of common gotchas before attempting exercises

### Less Effective Methods (Community Reports)
- ❌ Video-only learning without hands-on practice
- ❌ Simulator-heavy preparation without understanding underlying concepts
- ❌ Memorization of commands without understanding contexts
- ❌ Linear exercise progression without targeting weak areas

## Preparation Insights

### Estimated Study Timeline by Level

| Starting Level | Target | Realistic Time | Path |
|--------|--------|---------|------|
| Kubernetes beginner | Comprehensive readiness | 40-50 hours | All exercises + 2 mocks |
| Intermediate (k8s operator) | High competence | 25-35 hours | Targeted exercises + mocks |
| Advanced (already strong k8s) | Quick polish | 10-20 hours | Weak domain review + mock |

### Recommended Focus Areas
- Storage (PV/PVC/StorageClass): Essential knowledge
- Troubleshooting methodology: Critical for all candidates
- RBAC fundamentals: High-frequency topic
- Networking basics: Required for troubleshooting
